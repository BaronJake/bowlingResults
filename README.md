2018-2019 bowling results analytics

A project to analyze my bowling teams scores across the 2018-2019 season.
The purpose of this project is to see if there is any way to use statistics to improve bowling scores
The analytics will be run R, using hypothesis testing to see if there are any statistical differences between scores
Datasets are ~30 rows of scores, separated by game, dates, series, YTD pins and YTD games
I'm not confident that I will find anything interesting, but I figured I should try!
